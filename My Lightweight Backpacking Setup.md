My goal for backpacking is to create a "mentally" minimal setup, not necessarily "ultralight" (although traveling light is a big part of it).  Stuff that is easy, versatile, and small volume.\

I do incur a weight penalty for things that help organize, but for me it's worth it so I know exactly where items go.
