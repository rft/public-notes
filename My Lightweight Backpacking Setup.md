My goal for backpacking is to create a "mentally" minimal setup, not necessarily "ultralight" (although traveling light is a big part of it).  Stuff that is easy, versatile, and small volume.\

I do incur a weight penalty for things that help organize, but for me it's worth it so I know exactly where items go.

## Bear can - Bearikade Weekender 
Kind of expensive, but after looking at some pictures of https://imgur.com/a/ursack-bear-canister-failures-ZSwyHg4 about BV bear cans and ursacks I am more inclined to use this (could be a biased sample size though since the bearikade is a quite a bit more costly than the other options)

This can however is not IGBC certified, so it cannot be brought on certain trails. 

Lightest bear can for it's size, made from carbon fiber

I also use wallaby mylar bags to block out any scents, just so there's less of a reason to find the actual can. 


#### Mods
- Added reflective tape along circumference of container. Helps to spot in the morning when using headlamp. 
- Washer keychain loop attached to bag. 

It also can double as a chair

## Spoon - Toaks Titanium Spoon

## Bidet - BoglerCo Trowel 
Very lightweight Trowel, nice to use because of it's serrated edges and plastic end to make it easier to push 

## Tent Stakes - 
#### Mods
- Use a PVC pipe tube end to help push stakes into the ground.
