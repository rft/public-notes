# Basics
## Move 
`g` : sets whatever object that is selected into a moveable "state" that follows the cursor 
- Press `Shift` to be more precise on moving 
- Change the axis at which it moves on by pressing `x,y,z` 
- Exclude an axis for a move by doing `shift x,y,z` lets say for example you 

`alt+g`: sets to global ground (not actually what it does but need to change)
