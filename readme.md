This repo contains notes that are used for nomolabs.net

Most everything here is contained in a markdown format, though it is up for debate still if I am moving to neorg. 

All of these notes are organic hand picked without the use of any LLMs but some of the grammar may have been checked via a LLM (just the apple intelligence check)
